# This test file checks for the structure and behavior of the Shor's algorithm circuit. The `test_circuit_structure` validates the number of qubits and gates together with their corresponding types. The `test_simulation` function executes the specified number of shots and makes assertions about the counts of the measurements based on the expected distribution for Shor's algorithm specific to this circuit. Note that the expected distribution values may differ slightly depending on the simulation backend and the additional transpilation step.

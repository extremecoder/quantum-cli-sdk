# Quantum Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for your quantum computing project, created with the Quantum CLI SDK.

## Overview

This project provides a framework for developing, testing, and running quantum circuits. It includes tools for:

- Creating and manipulating quantum circuits
- Visualizing quantum states and results
- Applying error mitigation techniques
- Exposing quantum functionality through a web API

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**

   Ensure you have all dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Running the example**

   Execute the main script to see an example of creating and visualizing quantum circuits:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Creating your own circuits**

   Explore the `src/circuits` directory to see examples and create your own quantum circuits.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main source code
  - `circuits/` - Quantum circuit definitions
  - `utilities/` - Helper functions for visualization and error mitigation
  - `api/` - Web API for accessing quantum functionality
- `tests/` - Unit tests for the project
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `examples/` - Example usage scripts
- `data/` - Data files for input and output
- `results/` - Directory for storing execution results

## Next Steps

- See the [Examples](./examples.md) page for more usage scenarios
- Check the [API Documentation](./api.md) for details on the web API

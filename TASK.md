## Quantum CLI SDK Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Command Implementation
1. [x] 2023-10-15: Set up project structure and CLI framework
2. [x] 2024-08-02: Implement `init` command for project scaffolding
   The scaffolding should follow structure as shown in below pic
   ![Project Structure](./images/quantum-app-folder-structure.png)
3. [x] 2025-04-01: Create GitHub Actions workflow templates
   This template will basically be made available in the init generated scaffolding
4. [x] 2025-04-01: Implement `ir generate` command for OpenQASM conversion (Aligned with pipeline, LLM added)
5. [x] 2025-04-01: Implement `ir validate` command for IR verification (Aligned with pipeline)
6. [x] 2025-04-01: Implement `security scan` for vulnerability checking (Aligned with pipeline)
7. [x] 2025-04-01: Implement `run simulate` command with Qiskit backend (Aligned with pipeline, renamed --platform to --backend, added tests/docs)
8. [x] 2025-04-02: Add Cirq backend support to `run simulate` command (Note: QASM multi-bit measurement result aggregation needs improvement)
9. [x] 2024-07-29: Add Braket backend support to `run simulate` command
10. [x] 2023-11-30: Implement cross-platform compatibility testing (Added matrix strategy to e2e-pipeline.yml)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
11. [x] 2024-09-04: Implement `ir optimize` command for circuit optimization (Aligned with pipeline, L0/L1 implemented, L2/L3 placeholders)
12. [x] 2024-09-04: Implement `ir mitigate` command for error mitigation (Aligned with pipeline, placeholders added)
13. [ ] 2023-12-18: Implement `test generate` command for test generation (Aligned with pipeline)  
Generate tests using llm such a way that it tests the generated ir code from every aspect w.r.t to quantum, Except or assume the mitigated ir file to be present at appropriate folder in the scaffolding, use the one we have 
14. [ ] 2023-12-25: Implement `test run` command for running circuit tests (Aligned with pipeline)
15. [ ] 2024-01-05: Implement `analyze resources` command for resource estimation (Aligned with pipeline)

23. [ ] 2024-03-15: Implement `package create` command for application bundling (Aligned with pipeline)
24. [ ] 2024-03-25: Add Docker integration for microservice containerization
25. [ ] 2024-04-05: Implement versioning system for packages
26. [ ] 2024-04-15: Create deployment documentation

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration

30. [ ] 2024-05-25: Create API wrappers for Hub communication
31. [ ] 2024-06-05: Implement user analytics for published applications
32. [ ] 2024-06-15: Add monitoring capabilities for deployed microservices
33. [ ] 2024-06-25: Implement subscription management integration
